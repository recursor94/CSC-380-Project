# Project Description

Group : { Andrew Spano, Jimmy Nguyen, Zak Gudlin }

This project is a travel assistant application which can be used by a frequent flyer to book and manage their flights. 
Users will be able to book flights based on arrival time & destination, choose their seating (with additional costs),
setup their baggage plans (with additional costs), and manage their flights as well. Management features would 
include viewing the itinerary of their flight, making changes to their booked flight, and cancellation of 
said flight. Users would be presented with a list of hotels nearby their destination airport and be able to
book with said business based on available rooms (with rates). Users would be able to manage their hotel booking
as well. Car rentals nearby the destination airport would also be available to view as well as book/manage. 
All payments would be handled through the in-house system.
