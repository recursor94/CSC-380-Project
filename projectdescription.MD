Project Description

This project is a travel assistant which can be used by a travelling customer to book a flight, find a hotel in the region in which he or she is staying and arrange for transportation from the destination airport to his or her hotel.  The customer will have the option to book a flight, choose seating by class, row and aisle, check in baggage and either book a cab or find a rental car in advance.  Every transaction will be handled within the application.  The customer will be presented with a list of hotels in the local area, along with their ratings and customer reviews.
