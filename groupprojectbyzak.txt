Project Description:

This project is a travel assistant which can be used by a travelling customer to book a flight, find a hotel 
in the region in which he or she is staying and arrange for transportation from the destination airport to his 
or her hotel.  The customer will have the option to book a flight, choose seating by class, row and aisle, check 
in baggage and either book a cab or find a rental car in advance.  Every transaction will be handled within the 
application.  The customer will be presented with a list of hotels in the local area, along with their ratings 
and customer reviews.
